# Prediction-of-Coronary-Artery-Disease
A predictive model that can accurately identify individuals who have Coronary Artery isease (CAD)

The initial phase involved the utilization of data analysis and visualization techniques to gain valuable insights into the relationships among various variables in the dataset. This exploratory phase provided a crucial understanding of the dataset, enabling a more informed approach to subsequent model development.

The predictive modeling phase was characterized by a rigorous hyperparameter tuning procedure, ensuring that the machine learning models were fine-tuned for optimal performance.
